# language-gdscript package

GDScript (Godot Scripting Language) grammar for atom.io.

Converted from the sublime text grammar: https://github.com/beefsack/GDScript-sublime

A textmate version was created in the conversion process. I haven't tried it though.

### Currently

Just syntax highlighting. Autocompletion will come soon.

### Install

- `apm install language-gdscript`
- or from atom > settings > install
